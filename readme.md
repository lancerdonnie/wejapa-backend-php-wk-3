Week 3 We japa task

we will be making a simple signup form, which will be collecting these details.
First Name: type="text"
Second Name: type="text"
Email: type="text"
Date Of Birth: type="date"
Favorite color: type="color"
Gender: type="checkbox"
Department: dropdown (IT, HR, Stuff)
Password: strong password
A strong password has:
at least 15 characters
uppercase letters
lowercase letters
numbers
symbols, such as ` ! " ? \$ ? % ^ & \* ( ) \_ - + = { [ } ] : ; @ ' ~ # | \ < , > . ? /
after a user input data passes (is correct) and clicks on the submit button he/she must be taken to a new page with a background-color from her/his chosen favorite color. (Eg: if I choose blue then my next page must be having a blue background)
Note:
there is no specific styling so try and be creative by bringing up your own styling.
you must host your work after you are done. (i recommend to try using Heroku)
user a proper git workflow (don't push/merge on your master branch and create a feature branch for your work)
if you never had a chance to submit last week's work by submitting this work you will qualify to move to the next phase.
